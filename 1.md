Once the VM is booted , The first step we need to do is Find the IP Address of the CTF Machine. For this we can use tools like Netdiscover or Angry IP Scanner.

### Make sure the Network settings is set to BRIDGED ADAPTER

I am using Angry IP scanner.

Step 1: Type `ipconfig` in your cmd (Which will return the ip address of your network)

Step 2: Just copy the ip address and put in the angry ip scanner and alter the last octate(Start: 0 and End: 255)
eg: For my case my IP is 192.168.1.33
